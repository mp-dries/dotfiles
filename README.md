# Dotfiles config
My personal zsh, vim, git and tmux configuration.

### Basic Installation

Go to the directory where you want to install these dotfiles and install by running one of the following commands in your terminal.

#### Using curl

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drieshooghe/tomes/master/install.sh)"
```

#### Using wget

```shell
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drieshooghe/tomes/master/install.sh -O -)"
```

### Acknowledgements

Credit where credit is due.
In v2 a lot of the installation logic is based on the [dotfiles repo of Lowie Huyghe](https://github.com/LowieHuyghe/dotfiles).

The dotfiles configuration itself is an extension of the [thoughtbot dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles).
